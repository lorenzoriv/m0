# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I am very confident in my ability to use the each method.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I really liked pushing myself and having to take some initiative to learn on my own.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
i want to practice evrything more and i will do that by looking up more useses and question and working on them.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
i just want to know more uses for the each method and how far i can push it.
